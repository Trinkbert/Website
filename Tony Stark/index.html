        <article>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading
            data, writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. (The complete list of commands
            that can be run by a CPU is known as thatcomputerâ€™s instruction set ). Instruction sets are relatively
            small; most higher-order programming languages, such as C++, Ada, Fortran, or Visual Basic, must be compiled
            (or translated, or interpreted ) into these low level commands in order for a program to run.</article>
